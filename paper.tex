\begin{abstract}

\noindent The objective of test job scheduling techniques is to schedule test
jobs in an optimal order such that given a specific time budget a maximum
number of jobs can be executed. However, by simply ordering the jobs based on
execution time cannot ensure an optimal ordering due to several reasons; 1)
Jobs require resources before execution and setting up these resources requires
additional time; 2) Jobs with shortest execution time may not be the jobs that
have high effectiveness (e.g., coverage and fault detection capability). In
practice, there may be several tradeoff relationships among the cost and
effectiveness and such test job scheduling problem is a multi-objective
optimization problem. Search-based algorithms (e.g., (1+1) Evolutionary
Algorithm (EA)) have proven to provide an elegant solution for several multi-
objective problems. Driven by the test scheduling problem at Cisco Systems, we
define two objectives for such test job scheduling, i.e., job execution time
and resource hours (cost related to the required resources for a job) together
with test engineers at Cisco. We define a fitness function that considers both
of these objectives and is used by search algorithms to find an optimal
scheduling order. We empirically evaluate our fitness function in conjunction
with four search algorithms, i.e., (1+1)EA, Genetic Algorithm, Alternating
Variable Method, and Random Search (used as a baseline) using the provided test
database from Cisco. The results show that (1+1)EA along with our proposed
fitness function can schedule jobs by optimal order in a given time as compared
to the rest of the algorithms.

\section{Introduction}

When running automated tests as a main means of verifying software quick
feedback is incredibly important. To facilitate quick feedback automated tests
must be run after ever commit and as the list of tests that the test system
runs grows, the strategy for allocation becomes more and more important to keep
the feedback cycle as short as possible.

We discuss different search algorithms, their effectiveness in lowering the
number of resource hours and the effect of lowering resource hours on the
number of tests that can be run.

When discussing the number of resource hours throughout this paper we will draw
many parallels to parallelization of CPU bound problems. To draw a direct
parallel, one could say (with only slight loss of generality) that the goal of
an efficient search algorithm for a test system is to attempt to scale as close
to linearly when adding resources to the pool (as one would like to when adding
CPUs).


%------------------------------------------------

\section{Resource hours}

For this paper we define a term to give an equivalent to CPU hours for
resources. When allocating a specific resource to a test we assign a weight and
a cost to each resource that the test requires, the product of these two
factors gives us an idea of how large a hit the resource pool takes by
allocating this resource for the current test.

Context switching between tasks in a CPU bound problem can be expensive, and
should be minimized if possible. The equivalent is true for resource
allocation, a test requires a certain build of software on the resource, and
for it to be on a certain subnet for testing to make sense, and both these
operations take a certain amount of time depending on the type of resource in
question.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Search algorithm}

Each generation of resources for a test run must continue allocating until at
least one of the following criteria is met:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Every resource in the pool is allocated.
\item All jobs in the test queue have a resource, or an unsatisfiable required resource.
\end{compactitem}

Shaukat and Shuai! I NEED MORE HELP / INFO HERE ;)
 %------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Fitness function}

For the search algorithm to be able to know whether one generation of resource
allocations is better than another we need to have a fitness function.

We propose a fitness function for resource allocation:
\begin{equation}\label{fitness_func}
F(J, R) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{\left( \mu \left(J_{i}\right) \cdot \sum_{j=0}^{k}{R_{j_w} \cdot R_{j_C} } \right)}
\end{equation}

\noindent $\mu (R_j)$: The average historic runtime of job index j, or max runtime (if it has
never been run) \\
\noindent $R_{j_w}$: The weight of resource j (this will be discussed in detail later).\\
\noindent $R_{j_C}$: The cost of using resource j in the current task (this will be discussed in detail later).

By using \ref{fitness_func}, we find that

% Normalized so sum(weights) = 1
% mention resource cost as an analogue to context switching in CPU problems.

\section{Methods}

The following search algorithms were verified using test data supplied by CISCO systems:

\begin{compactitem}
\item (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm
\item Genetic Algorithm
\item Alternating Variable Method

\end{compactitem}
